THIS IS THE MAIN GITHUB README, FRIENDS
=========================

You should write READMEs in **Markdown**, which is a very simple markup language for plain text documents that plays nicely with the web & HTML. Markdown's syntax is designed to be readable either marked up or rendered. That means you can read it in plain text, and when stuff is supposed to be *italicized*, it's not a big deal if you see the asterisks. You can read it just fine. With a more complicated markup language like LaTeX or HTML, this isn't the case. (Press CTRL+U on any website to see how ugly reading HTML would be.) 

READMEs should describe the contents of the directory and provide detailed instructions for users.
