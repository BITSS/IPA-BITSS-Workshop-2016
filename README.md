THIS IS THE README, FRIENDS
=========================

You should write READMEs in **Markdown**, which is a very simple markup language that plays nicely with HTML. Markdown's syntax is designed to be readable either marked up or rendered. That means you can read it in plain text, and when stuff is supposed to be *italicized*, it's not a big deal if you see the asterisks. You can read it just fine. With a more complicated markup language like LaTeX or HTML, this isn't the case. (Press CTRL+U on any website to see how ugly reading HTML would be.) 

READMEs should describe the contents of the directory and provide detailed instructions for users.

This repository will eventually contain several files for IPA-BITSS Workshop March 7-8 in Athi River, Kenya.

1. GitHub Desktop App demo files
2. Dynamic Document demo files
