Outline of GitHub Desktop Demo
==============================

To get started:

1. Download and install the GitHub Desktop app.
2. Download and install MarkdownPad.
3. Setup the app by telling it your GitHub user name (which you need to create if you haven't already).

Tasks:

1. Create a new repository.
2. What files are in it?
3. Add a README.md
4. Commit the changes.
5. Make some more changes, and also add a .do file.
6. What does changes look like? History?










Most experienced users will use Git via the command line. (Terminal on a Mac, the Git Shell that came with the Desktop app, Windows PowerShell, there are a lot of options. They're all where you type commands for your computer to execute.) You can read why [here](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/173297/why-learn-git-when-there-are-gui-apps-for-github). Basically, it's more powerful.
